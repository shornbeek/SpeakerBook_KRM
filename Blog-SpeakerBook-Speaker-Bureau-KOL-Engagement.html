                <h4>January 30, 2020</h4>
                <h5>By: Stephen</h5>

                <p class="paddinglefty">
                    SpeakerBook Oncology is a pharma sales application created to help Pharma reps find local KOL’s to
                    improve peer to peer marketing strategies. ROI is a top metric in Pharma and Medical Device sales.
                    SpeakerBook Oncology provides improved ROI and sales solutions for the individual sales rep and
                    large enterprise organizations.

                </p>
                <p class="paddinglefty">
                    Peer to peer selling is the most effective marketing channel in Pharma and Medical Device marketing.
                    Customer poll after customer poll demonstrate that physicians value peer to peer opportunities head
                    and shoulders above nearly every other marketing tactic in a Pharma marketing team's toolkit. More
                    than TV ads, journal ads, or that latest and greatest interactive sales aid, the peer to peer
                    opportunity has the clearest ROI.
                </p>

                <p class="paddinglefty">
                    Doctors no longer want to go to dinners at a nice steak restaurant. The doctors who do show up are
                    not important, and are just looking for a free meal. Every sales manager has heard these excuses
                    before. The excuses don't help sales. The reality is that peer to peer marketing is extremely
                    effective.
                </p>

                <p class="paddinglefty">
                    So how does a brand team get improved results from their peer to peer marketing efforts? The KPIs on
                    peer to peer selling are like a treasure trove of implementation data. Who are the most utilized
                    Speakers, Why? Which topics are attracting the key customers? Which Reps are doing the best job
                    driving key customer attendance? Which venues and formats provide the best attendance? Are certain
                    topics and data needed for specific populations and areas of the country? Do the speaker topics need
                    to be more patient-centric to the local markets? Are some speakers better at delivering certain
                    topics than others? What is the field telling you?
                </p>

                <p class="paddinglefty">
                    Without an effective KPI reporting and monitoring tool, a field sales management team cannot
                    effectively execute a peer to peer marketing initiative. Also, without real time metric feedback via
                    field execution, how can a brand team pivot, react, and deliver tools to impact the marketplace.
                    Without an understanding of the competitors speaker bureau activities, a brand team is really just
                    flying blind with no benchmarks, nor a reality of their true KOL relationships.
                </p>

                <p class="paddinglefty bottompady">
                    The SpeakerBook suite of products is designed to address these issues and provide tools to drive
                    sales through the peer to peer marketing channel. Current Spreadsheets and PowerPoint decks for FLAT
                    and BORING. Teleconferences are not friendly when optimizing peer to peer selling efforts. Enough
                    time (and Money, and OPPORTUNITY) has been wasted.
                </p>

            <h2 class="textgrade">The Future of Pharma Reps after Coronavirus</h2>
            <h4>March 12, 2020</h4>
            <h5>By: Brian</h5>

            <p class="paddinglefty">
                With Covid-19 presenting significant risks to the elderly and immunocompromised patients across the
                world, health care facilities have become hotbeds of the Viral Spread. Doctor's offices, hospitals, ER
                Clinics, and outpatient centers are now on high alert in an effort to protect their patients and their
                Health Care Practitioners. As we view images of the authorities in Hazmat suits spraying down entire
                cities with disinfectant, we are reminded of just how contagious the Covid-19 virus is in these Health
                Care Facilities.
            </p>

            <p class="paddinglefty">
                Perhaps the one profession that may be most at risk of catching and potentially spreading Covid-19 is
                the Pharma/Medical Sales representative. Depending on the product, these sales professionals may be
                traveling from one contaminated waiting room to another in their efforts to see between 5-10 physicians
                per day. Of course, since these professionals interact with health care professionals each day, they can
                quickly adapt to the safety measures of the health care practices. However, as we've seen with the sad
                deaths in the nursing home in Kirkland, WA, the health care facilities with the most fragile patients,
                (potentially Oncology Clinics, and infectious disease offices) may be among the most risky for sales
                reps to visit. The risks are twofold, both the risk of getting sick, and the risk of potentially
                spreading the virus from office to office as the rep tries to get 8-10 calls per day.
            </p>

                So how can a Pharma rep and the Pharma company reduce these risks associated with their jobs? For now,
                Pharma is probably keeping the reps at home in the most risky areas of the country. Doctors' offices may
                be creating different protocols for reps to follow in order to reduce any contamination risks in their
                offices. When this virus is contained, and life starts to return to normal, what is the future of
                Pharma??

                <h3>Pharma sales reps keep the iPad in the car</h3> 



            <p class="paddinglefty">
                The glorious world of interactive visual aids on the iPad may see an abrupt end. In the Post-Covid-19
                era, is it really a good idea for thousands of health care professionals to touch iPads that are
                circulated from office to office? Also, these Interactive Visual Aids are designed to increase
                "interaction" by the health care professionals. If a physician just left the room of a contagious
                patient, and "interacted" with a Sales Rep's iPad, how many other doctors will interact with this
                contaminated device?
            </p>

            <p class="paddinglefty">
                Obviously the reps are going to clean their devices, wash their hands and follow all the protocols of
                their company. However, will the doctors trust them to keep those iPads Covid-19 free? Should the
                doctors trust them as they attempt to protect their patients from the deadly disease and potential
                contamination? In the Post-Covid-19 era, interpersonal interactions such as hugs, handshakes,
                fist-bumps, high fives, are probably going to be replaced by a polite hello...especially in a health
                care facility. Catered group lunches in the doctor's office may not be such a good idea anymore. Of
                course, that one item that seems to travel from waiting room to waiting room, from doctors' hands to
                doctors' hands, from catered lunch to catered lunch, ...that big iPad should probably stay in the care,
                or at home.

            <h3>So what is next for Pharma sales reps?</h3> 


            <p class="paddinglefty">
                The Pharma/Medical Device reps play an essential role in our health care world. Our health care
                providers rely on these professionals to support them with product information, patient resources,
                product samples, and some opportunities to learn from the best and brightest researchers and clinicians
                in their field. While maybe not absolutely essential, these interactions seem to be most effective
                through personal contact.
            </p>

            <p class="paddinglefty">
                Pharma/Medical Device companies will need to develop protocols to keep their reps safe and their
                customers and their patients free from cross contamination from rep office visits.
            </p>

            <p class="paddinglefty bottompady">
                The visual sales aid may eventually return to some form of recycled paper, which is disposed after each
                interaction with a doctor. Perhaps each sales aid is sealed in plastic, and opened by the physicians
                themselves? Perhaps the reps will use a mini projector on a white wall, to further prevent the need to
                touch a susceptible surface? The days of munching on a sandwich in the back break room and then touching
                an iPad may be over.
